# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for ReliableNet

## 1. Overview (Updated)
ReliableNet now focuses on **hyperlocal, community-driven internet quality**. Along with broad ISP comparisons and speed test results, the platform will feature **apartment complex** and **neighborhood-level** data. Residents and prospective tenants can see aggregated feedback on network stability, packet loss, and overall reliability within a specific building or community.

This pivot enhances ReliableNet's original mission by providing more granular and trustable data for individuals who rely on stable internet for remote work, streaming, or gaming—particularly in apartment settings.

   - "Tips" or "FAQ" section to improve in-building networking setups  
   - Advanced analytics for building managers (e.g., daily reliability metrics)

## 3. Deployment Plan (Updated)
1. **Landing Page**: Complete, with added emphasis on apartment/neighborhood search.  
2. **Backend Setup**:  
   - **API & Database** connections for speed tests, ISP metrics, and apartment complexes.  
   - Prisma migrations ensuring building-level data is stored properly.  
3. **Frontend Development**:  
   - Implement new apartment listing and review pages (Phase 1).  
   - Integrate building-level coverage into the ISP Comparison Tool (Phase 2).  
4. **Testing & Optimization**:  
   - Conduct user testing of apartment-level features.  
   - Performance and security checks for new endpoints.  
   - Expand review moderation to handle building-specific feedback.  
5. **Full Launch**:  
   - Deploy the updated version with apartment-based reviews.  
   - Gather feedback from early adopters and refine.  

This PRD reflects a **hyperlocal pivot**, adding apartment-complex–specific features, community reviews, and expanded coverage data—while preserving all existing ISP comparisons and speed test functionality.
