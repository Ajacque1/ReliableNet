## Known Vulnerabilities

### Low Severity
1. **Package**: `cookie` < 0.7.0
   - **Issue**: Accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters
   - **Status**: Active
   - **Impact**: Low severity
   - **Affected Dependencies**:
     - `@auth/core` <= 0.35.3
     - `next-auth` <= 0.0.0-pr.11562.ed0fce23 || 4.24.8 - 5.0.0-beta.22
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Currently using latest versions of `next-auth` and `@auth/core`
     - Monitoring for updates to `cookie` package
     - Implementing strict cookie validation in our application

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js with secure session handling
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure cookie handling

### API Security
- Input validation with Zod
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Automated Security Scanning

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for security scanning
- Weekly automated scans
- Scans on push to main and pull requests
- Multiple security tools:
  - npm audit
  - Snyk security scan
  - OWASP ZAP full scan
- Automated notifications on failures
- Artifact storage for scan results

### Required Secrets
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: For Snyk security scanning
- `APP_URL`: For OWASP ZAP scanning

### Scan Results
- Available as artifacts in GitHub Actions
- Includes:
  - OWASP ZAP results
  - Snyk security report
  - npm audit results
